# techwins_analytics

This repo is home to dashboards and tooling designed to shed light on how long use cases spend in each U-phase (U1 → U5) within Salesforce. Because flying blind through a sales process is so last decade.

We extract and timestamp key transitions (e.g., U2 → U4) using sources like Logfood, then visualize trends, averages, and outliers—per SA manager, per use case, or however else we need to make the invisible visible.

Perfect for:

🔍 Diagnosing bottlenecks

📈 Coaching SAs with data

🧠 Driving accountability and better forecasting
